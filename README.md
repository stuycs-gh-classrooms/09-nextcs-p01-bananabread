### Overview
Your mission is create either:
- Life-like cellular automata [life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life), [life-like](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life-like_cellular_automaton), [demo](https://www.netlogoweb.org/launch#https://www.netlogoweb.org/assets/modelslib/Sample%20Models/Computer%20Science/Cellular%20Automata/Life.nlogo).
- Breakout/Arkanoid [demo 0](https://elgoog.im/breakout/)  [demo 1](https://www.crazygames.com/game/atari-breakout)
- Space Invaders/Galaga

This project will be completed in phases. The first phase will be to work on this document. Use markdown formatting.

## Phase 0: Selection, Analysis & Plan

#### Selected Project: Breakout

### Necessary Features
What are the core features that your program should have? These should be things that __must__ be implemented in order to make the program useable/playable, not extra features that could be added to make the program more interesting/fun.

- Two classes, one for the wall and the other for the ball
- Platform that follows the mouse
- Ball that bounces off border, platform, and wall
- Wall that breaks if ball hits it

### Extra Features
What are some features that are not essential to the program, but you would like to see (provided you have time after completing the necessary features. Theses can be customizations that are not part of the core requirements.

- Make ball speed quicker as game goes on
- Adding another ball
- Smaller platform

### Array Usage
How will you be using arrays in this project?

1D Array:
- Rows of the wall

2D Array:
- Column of the wall


### Controls
How will your program be controlled? List all keyboard commands and mouse interactions.

Keyboard Commands:
- R to reset
- Space to pause

Mouse Control:
- Mouse movement: Platform follows mouse side to side
- Mouse pressed: Nothing


### Classes
What classes will you be creating for this project? Include the instance variables and methods that you believe you will need. You will be required to create at least 2 different classes. If you are going to use classes similar to those we've made for previous assignments, you will have to add new features to them.
